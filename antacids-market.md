<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antacids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Systemic Antacids</li><li>Systemic Antacids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antacids market is categorized into two main types: non-systemic antacids and systemic antacids. Non-systemic antacids act locally in the stomach to neutralize gastric acid, providing quick relief from heartburn and indigestion without affecting the body's overall acid-base balance.

Both types serve to alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort, but their modes of action differ significantly.</p></p>
